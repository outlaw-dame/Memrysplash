# History of the world

This history business is a big mess.

To be honest, no one remembers what happened a few hours away. Maybe that passenger had lunch, maybe not.

What happened months away is complete mystery. Years? Don't even start.

All in all, history of the world is a fertile ground for all sorts of machinations, and that's the best part of it.

Try to explore that history in your spare time too. You'll be befuddled by the sheer amount of things that you could imagine happening.
